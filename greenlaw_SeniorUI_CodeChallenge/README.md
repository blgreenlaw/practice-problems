The following files are my solutions to the code challenge problems worked on for the Fidelity Senior UI position in Salt Lake City, UT.

Included Files:
*arrayRotate.js
*bstHeight.js
*factorial.js

Notes about the files:
	* For testing, each file includes the unit tests created as part of my test-driven development. They are located at the end of the files, and there
	is a JSFiddle link to accommodate viewing the testing on different machines (that might have different testing configurations.)
	* The problems were chosen in combination with difficulty and not already having a JS solution inside the forked repository.
	* The original BST Height README has been updated to reflect the correct height parameters, the problem used to have an example that if there was 
	one node in the tree, that the height would return as "0", but trees with just a root node (one node total) have a height of "1". So that is what my 	version of the problem solves for. (Trees are not zero-indexed, but rather one-indexed.)
